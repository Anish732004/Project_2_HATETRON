# Project_2_HATETRON

This study introduces HateTron, a chatbot for detecting Hate Speech, Offensive Language, and Safe Speech  that achieves 90% accuracy by using logistic regression. The study's background is the growing demand for efficient automated systems to find/identify and report/address hate-speech on internet.

For my Project - 2. My team and I had developed a Mobile Application called HATETRON.
